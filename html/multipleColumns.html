    CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
    including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve
    content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
    of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting
    by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity
    and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to
    improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present
    the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods,
    such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader),
    and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting
    if the content is accessed on a mobile device.   CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content,
