        The search engine went through many updates in attempts to eradicate search
        engine optimization abuse, provide dynamic updating of results, and make
        the indexing system rapid and flexible.  Search results started to be personalized in 2005,
        and later Google Suggest <span class="txt-decor-underline">autocompletion </span>was introduced.
        From 2007,<span class="txt-decor-underline">Universal Search</span>
        provided all types of content, not just text content, in search results.
